  Let's see what I can do with Jekyll. You can edit this
  line in _config.yml. It will appear in your document head meta (for
  Google search results) and in your feed.xml site description.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: "http://localhost:4000" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: jekyllrb
github_username:  jekyll

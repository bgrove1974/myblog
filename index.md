This is a prototype blog made in Jekyll. Nothing important, just stuff to play around with, build, break, and fix. I am following a tutorial by Andrew Munsell that can be found at https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example.

My name is Ben, and I am learning Web Development. I am familiar with HTML, Javascript, and CSS, but damn if I don't love me some Ruby on Rails. Now, don't get me wrong, Rails is awesome, but sometimes it is just a bit of overkill for a site such as this. Besides, I should broaden my horizons so that I am not doing everything with Rails, so this Javascripte is made with Jekyll, Twitter Bootstrap, a little bit of Ruby, and the aforementioned HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

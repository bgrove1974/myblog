<h3>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Ben, and I am learning Web Development. I am familiar with HTML, Javascript, and CSS, but damn if I don't love me some Ruby on Rails. Now, don't get me wrong, Rais is awesome, but sometimes it is just a bit overkill for a site such as this. Besides, I should broaden my horizons so that I am not doing everything with Rails, so this side is made with Jekyll, Twitter Bootstrap, a little bit of Ruby, and the aforementioned HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

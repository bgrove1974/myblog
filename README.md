This is a boilerplate Jekyll site from https://www.jekyllrb.com.

I'm working my way through Andrew Munsell's Jekyll tutorial at https://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example

This tutorial uses an older version of Bootstrap, probably 2x, whereas I am using v3.3.2. I'm focusing on the Jekyll part first, then playing around with Bootstrap later.
